        text: 'We created a campaign that immerses the viewer in stunning images that highlight the natural purity and power of water, and at the same time convey the importance of delivering renewable, sustainable sources of energy that will help make Queensland self-sufficient, deliver jobs and opportunities for local workers and school leavers, and ensure a brighter future for all Queenslanders. How can something as simple as water hold the key to our clean energy future? Hydro is how.'
