        text: 'The University Of New England will celebrate its 70th birthday in 2024. It was the first university in Australia to be established outside of a capital city, and its unique location remains one of its defining qualities and outstanding assets. Our brief was to ensure the universityâ€™s modern, forward-looking focus aligned seamlessly with its rich history.'

        text: 'It is a human truth that we are shaped by the places and environments that surround us. Showcasing the campus as a character that shares the daily lives of the students who study there enabled us to breathe life into the idea that tradition and history are the keys that unlock the potential in all of us.'
